            <desc>[Seldom] This is a port and expansion of dodger.py into Unity. It's a crunchy arcade-style game about squares.</desc>
            <long>[Seldom] I never thought that I would devote so much time to the original idea of dodger.py, but here we are. This is a crunchy arcade-style game about squares. I think the title gives a good enough picture of the gameplay. I turned dodger.py into a Unity game because a club I was part of was going to put on an arcade-themed game jam, so I wanted to make an example game to give to potential sponsors, and to put up for inspiration. Even though the game jam has been cancelled, I've decided to finish the game and put it online for sale.</long>

            <title>Season 1 Java CLIs</title>
            <time>November 2018 - January 2020</time>
            <desc>[Seldom] Java was quite a step up from Python. I got pretty good at it, so it became my default language until Rust.</desc>
            <long>[Seldom] HCN Generator (November 2018): Generates highly composite numbers. Threw this together real quick when it became relevant in a conversation.\n\nDandy (February 2019 - April 2019): An extra project I did for a class. It's a Java terminal game based on D&amp;D. Although I went above and beyond in the project, it's not very good as a game. It's either short and unfair or long and tedious. Also there's a bug when an enemy throws a projectile at you where you get to choose the target. As normal, you'll have to compile it yourself.\n\nSongSort (July 2019): Merge sorts your songs in order of preference. Can be used for other tasks requiring sorting and user input. Written in Java. Optimized for QWERTY, but if you prefer another layout, like I do, just change the 'z' in the program to whatever other character is preferable, and optionally, change the prompt to reflect this.\n\nHand Comparison (November 2018 - August 2019): Another small side project. Compares two poker hands and determines which one wins.\n\nKotH Connect 4 (January 2020): I made this King of the Hill challenge for Poly Game Dev Club. King of the Hill is a game where many players compete to make simple bots to beat each other's bots in a simple game. That game is Connect 4. Unfortunately, I had to write it in Java, because that's what my peers know. At the time of writing this, we haven't played yet.</long>

            <title>Season 1 Rust CLIs</title>
            <time>July 2019 - January 2020</time>
            <desc>[Seldom] I taught myself Rust over the Summer of 2019, which was worth it, and it has since become my favorite programming language.</desc>
            <long>[Seldom] Pascal's Triangle Generator 4 (July 2019): This is the final version of Pascal's Triangle Generator. I thought it would be a nice exercise, since I was teaching myself Rust, and my previous versions could easily be optimized. This one simply remembers the previous line and generates the next based on it, like how a human would generate it. Simple as can be. Each line takes O(n) time. I make a silly tradition of dedicating my math programs to math teachers/instructors, but I'll have to pass on this one.\n\nsecret_santa (July 2019): This seems like something weird to make in July. I made it for Brakenym real quick because she was hosting an animation Secret Santa, and she wanted to start early.\n\nGame of Life (October 2019 -  January 2020): This is a cellular automaton simulator I made. It does things other than Game of Life, despite it's name. The download is actually set to starwars, my favorite cellular automaton. Everything you have to change for switching cellular automata is marked in the source code.</long>

            <title>HCN Generators</title>
            <time>November 2019 - January 2020</time>
            <desc>[Seldom] Four highly composite number generators I made for a class. They use a clever algorithm I adapted from a paper.</desc>
            <long>[Seldom] Highly composite numbers are very interesting to me, so I was exploring mathematical papers about them. After writing an inefficient generator in Java, I looked into their generation and stumbled across the paper linked below. It describes how to generate HCNs quickly with a clever algorithm, with some sample code written in BASIC attached. However, that code did not end up in the copy I uncovered, and I couldn't find any other program using this method, so I decided to write it myself...four times. I threw a little bit of the initial stuff together in Rust, but I ended up turning this into a project for a programming languages class I was taking at the time. So, I scrapped the Rust version, and wrote it in C, C++, Racket (which is like Scheme, which is a dialect Lisp), and Prolog. The Racket version came out the best. More information about each is included in the download. Below are the first 256 hcns, which I generated on my beefier machine. I modified my Racket program to be compatible with Scheme, by removing the Racket header and replacing 'list*' with 'cons', and ran it on mit-scheme. It took surprisingly little time. Perhaps it's for the best that I can't find the BASIC version, because with 5 of the HCN generators (Java, C, C++, Racket, and Prolog), I only need the last HCN generator, until I can compile them all into the Absurdly Large Number Gauntlet, at which point I would rule over a decent portion of the universe.\n\nHighly Composite Numbers:\n1\n2\n4\n6\n12\n24\n36\n48\n60\n120\n180\n240\n360\n720\n840\n1260\n1680\n2520\n5040\n7560\n10080\n15120\n20160\n25200\n27720\n45360\n50400\n55440\n83160\n110880\n166320\n221760\n277200\n332640\n498960\n554400\n665280\n720720\n1081080\n1441440\n2162160\n2882880\n3603600\n4324320\n6486480\n7207200\n8648640\n10810800\n14414400\n17297280\n21621600\n32432400\n36756720\n43243200\n61261200\n73513440\n110270160\n122522400\n147026880\n183783600\n245044800\n294053760\n367567200\n551350800\n698377680\n735134400\n1102701600\n1396755360\n2095133040\n2205403200\n2327925600\n2793510720\n3491888400\n4655851200\n5587021440\n6983776800\n10475665200\n13967553600\n20951330400\n27935107200\n41902660800\n48886437600\n64250746560\n73329656400\n80313433200\n97772875200\n128501493120\n146659312800\n160626866400\n240940299600\n293318625600\n321253732800\n481880599200\n642507465600\n963761198400\n1124388064800\n1606268664000\n1686582097200\n1927522396800\n2248776129600\n3212537328000\n3373164194400\n4497552259200\n6746328388800\n8995104518400\n9316358251200\n13492656777600\n18632716502400\n26985313555200\n27949074753600\n32607253879200\n46581791256000\n48910880818800\n55898149507200\n65214507758400\n93163582512000\n97821761637600\n130429015516800\n195643523275200\n260858031033600\n288807105787200\n391287046550400\n577614211574400\n782574093100800\n866421317361600\n1010824870255200\n1444035528936000\n1516237305382800\n1732842634723200\n2021649740510400\n2888071057872000\n3032474610765600\n4043299481020800\n6064949221531200\n8086598962041600\n10108248702552000\n12129898443062400\n18194847664593600\n20216497405104000\n24259796886124800\n30324746107656000\n36389695329187200\n48519593772249600\n60649492215312000\n72779390658374400\n74801040398884800\n106858629141264000\n112201560598327200\n149602080797769600\n224403121196654400\n299204161595539200\n374005201994424000\n448806242393308800\n673209363589963200\n748010403988848000\n897612484786617600\n1122015605983272000\n1346418727179926400\n1795224969573235200\n2244031211966544000\n2692837454359852800\n3066842656354276800\n4381203794791824000\n4488062423933088000\n6133685312708553600\n8976124847866176000\n9200527969062830400\n12267370625417107200\n15334213281771384000\n18401055938125660800\n27601583907188491200\n30668426563542768000\n36802111876251321600\n46002639845314152000\n55203167814376982400\n73604223752502643200\n92005279690628304000\n110406335628753964800\n131874234223233902400\n184010559381256608000\n263748468446467804800\n368021118762513216000\n395622702669701707200\n527496936892935609600\n659371171116169512000\n791245405339403414400\n1186868108009105121600\n1318742342232339024000\n1582490810678806828800\n1978113513348508536000\n2373736216018210243200\n3164981621357613657600\n3956227026697017072000\n4747472432036420486400\n5934340540045525608000\n7912454053394034144000\n11868681080091051216000\n15824908106788068288000\n17407398917466875116800\n18594267025475980238400\n23737362160182102432000\n30990445042459967064000\n34814797834933750233600\n37188534050951960476800\n52222196752400625350400\n55782801076427940715200\n61980890084919934128000\n74377068101903920953600\n92971335127379901192000\n111565602152855881430400\n148754136203807841907200\n185942670254759802384000\n223131204305711762860800\n278914005382139703576000\n371885340509519604768000\n557828010764279407152000\n743770681019039209536000\n818147749120943130489600\n985496152350226952635200\n1115656021528558814304000\n1487541362038078419072000\n1636295498241886260979200\n1970992304700453905270400\n2454443247362829391468800\n2956488457050680857905600\n3284987174500756508784000\n3941984609400907810540800\n4927480761751134763176000\n5912976914101361715811200\n7883969218801815621081600\n9854961523502269526352000\n11825953828202723431622400\n14782442285253404289528000\n19709923047004539052704000\n29564884570506808579056000\n39419846094009078105408000\n43361830703409985915948800\n54202288379262482394936000\n59129769141013617158112000\n78839692188018156210816000\n86723661406819971831897600\n108404576758524964789872000\n130085492110229957747846400\n162606865137787447184808000\n193814243295544634018256000\n216809153517049929579744000\n290721364943316951027384000\n325213730275574894369616000\n433618307034099859159488000\n563703799144329816907334400\n581442729886633902054768000\n650427460551149788739232000\n867236614068199718318976000\n872164094829950853082152000\n1084045767585249647898720000\n1162885459773267804109536000</long>

            <desc>[Seldom] A sort of tower defense game. A port of cthulhu.py to GameMaker, plus improvements.</desc>
            <long>[Seldom] In this game, you build a base while defending it from demons, like in cthulhu.py, which it's based off of. The game is quite hard if you can't play quickly, or if you don't read the descriptions thoroughly. You only use the mouse to play. Left click builds or removes contructs, right click pans, and the scroll wheel allows you to zoom from your cursor's position. I made this game as a project for a class, but I made most of it in a day, staying up until 9 the next morning. I think it turned out really well, except that it crashes due to disorganization in how objects track each other. I don't intend to fix it, because I want to expand this project even further in the future. For this reason, I will also not release the source code.</long>

            <desc>A competitive 2-player arcade-style game, where you try to collect cash faster than your opponent</desc>
            <long>[Seldom] Robbin' and Rollin' is a competitive 2-player arcade-style game, where you try to collect cash faster than your opponent. It was a 6-person group project for a class, but I ended up doing most of the work, since some of my group members were lazy, and others didn't have the technical skill yet. I think it turned out great, though. It's really fun, as long as both players are actually trying to win. There is also a Capture the Flag gamemode, which is much less fun. It could easily be fixed if your flag disappeared when you pick up your opponent's, but I don't want to mess with the code again. There are lots of powerups and weapons, which make the game a blast. You will want to read some of the information in the README for the controls.</long>

            <desc>A divider I wrote in Verilog for a class</desc>
            <long>[Seldom] I decided to make a divider in Verilog for a class. The class didn't go into Verilog that much, so it's not that good. Also, there's a pretty bad bug where you can only divide on certain frames. This is not a problem if you convert it to a circuit, though. It's just the limitations of the language when you use it in unintended ways.</long>

            <desc>An iPhone app for color blind people that tells you what color the camera sees.</desc>
            <long>[Seldom] This was my first time in a while working with Swift, and I really enjoyed it. This project was made by Vik from StreamWork and me at a hackathon called sunhacks. The app averages the color values of the pixels on the screen and tells you what it thinks the color is, to be used by color blind folks. Unfortunately, it just uses the raw color values, and doesn't have a sense for lighting, so it is very inaccurate. It also lags a lot when calculating. If we had more time, we would take far fewer samples, so the color updates seamlessly, and find a solution to the inaccuracy, like basing the color estimates on hue. We didn't present, because of scheduling issues, but I think we would have won in some category.</long>

            <long>[Vit] This is a silly game where you play as a rapid-fire ranger against an endless hoard of blue trolls. They're also apparently immortal, and whenever you beat one, it comes back with a friend. Good luck. This game was made for Weekly Game Jam 106. The theme was "Oh No!" This was my first game jam, and the first game that I have completed on a device more advanced than a graphing calculator. It was made in six days, was alot of fun, and also sometimes difficult to get things to work right, but I made it, and now I have a game!</long>

We made an app that creates safe walking routes between locations based on crime data we got access to from police departments. We didn't win, but the judges were impressed at what we could accomplish as a team of freshmen. </long>

            <long>[Seldom] This was originally a birthday present for Vit, but I kept adding features and it got bigger and bigger until Python 3/pygame couldn't handle the weight. This became the prototype for Super Dodge Mania! If you want nightmares, check out the collide() method at the bottom. That takes in two lists of rectangles and spits out the rectangles formed by their collisions. Move with WASD and dash by holding down a direction and pressing space. You cannot dash directly after getting hit. This one makes you feel less trapped than Super Dodge Mania! since the enemies pass through you instead of bouncing. It is implied that you lose when the screen is black. This uses pygame and Python 3, so you'll need to install these to run it. If you can find out how to install those, I trust you to know how to run it. Making this game helped me realize how much I need to make games.</long>

            <long>[Seldom] My submission for the Extra Credits Game Jam. Very unintuitive, but it's interesting, so I'd call it a success. The code is very hacked together, since I never needed to expand on it. Maybe I'll make this into a full game one day. It's in Python 3 and pygame, and hopefully it's my last, except for education and nostalgia. Play with the mouse, but don't click on the barracks at the start, because that will delete it, and the game will go black. If you can get through the confusion, you might find it a surprisingly deep game with interesting strategies. Try to get a high score. If I tell you the point of the game, it would go against the point of the game. The start screen has very important information, so I recommend reading it carefully, and then reading it carefully again after you begin to grasp the game.</long>

            <long>[Seldom] Out of the blue, Vit started making this game based on Redstone Puzzles, and Brakenym and I joined in on the fun. We called ourselves Flight of the Walkaries. This is a web application because Vit did the programming, but it doesn't work in Firefox. It appears to work in Chrome and Safari. Move with the arrow keys and press space to place wires. There are things on the wall that you have to connect to open and close doors. Don't use the mouse to solve puzzles, since the mouse is used for the level editor. You can make your own levels and save them with the menu at the top. You can also select from my levels in the dropdown. I recommend playing through lines, fork, inception, and parkour. inception is the best level. mesaroom is okay, and story is edgy because it's not subtle enough, but there aren't enough features to make many more interesting levels. If you get stuck moving a direction, press the arrow key in the direction you're moving, and it should unstick you. I'm very proud of this game, and I hope to make a full game from it someday.</long>

            <long>[Vit] A program I made to display conversations in a format like Homestuck's pesterchum logs. This was originally a Christmas present for Seldom during our senior year of high school. The original conversation was interactive, but also had personal stuff, so I decided not to put it online for some random person to see. After I made it, I found a few other uses for it, such as making an archive for a chat room me and my friends had used in high school and middle school. It's coded in html and js, and as long as you have a conversation in the right format, you can pretty much display anything. Feel free to try it out.</long>

            <long>[Seldom] Memory Tic-Tac-Toe (Summer 2016): My first Python game! I took a Python course one Summer, so I used the free time I had from being far ahead my classmates to make this game. I remember, the teacher was teasing me about how I only made it a memory game because I was too lazy to have to figure out how to show the grid, so I put the grid at the end to let him know I'm not screwing around. Turns out I'm really bad at this game because I have a really bad visual memory. This is actually not the original program. I ironed out a few bugs before releasing it. You need Python 3 to run this. Sometimes I forget that the Mac command is $ python3 memory_tic_tac_toe.py not $ python memory_tic_tac_toe.py because the latter is the Linux command, so reminder about that.\n\nexercise10.py (Summer 2016): Severe photosensitive epilepsy warning! I'm not exactly sure what exercise10 was supposed to be, but probably not this. I like to think that this eventually inspired Super Dodge Mania!, which is absolutely false. If you like to live dangerously or give yourself epileptic attacks, run it with Python 3 and pygame. If not, I assure you, you're not missing out on much here.\n\nShape Eater (Summer 2016): The absolute beginnings of Super Dodge Mania! I reused this code in Sentinel, whose code I reused in dodger.py. It runs on Python 3 and pygame, so you will need to install those.\n\nDon't Move (Fall 2016?): I tried to make a top-down game, but it didn't get very far. It's in Python 3 and pygame. It's not very interesting, but I'm leaving it here for the record.</long>

            <long>[Vit] This is the most advanced Minecraft mod I have written. It allows you to create fake players that act like real ones. It was difficult to make, mostly because of using minecraft source code in  ways that wasn't intended. This version isn't actually the latest version. I uploaded this to Github because I wanted advice, but nobody really had experience in the areas I was asking about. After this version I added features that allow you to change the players' skins, and they can also move around, fight, and craft. This version is now lost. Also, when I tried building a .jar file, it didn't work, so unfortunately if you want to try this out, you're gonna need to copy the source code into an IDE.</long>

            <long>[Vit] Me and Seldom used to work on these puzzles that he came up with based on redstone. We would draw puzzles on graph paper and work on them in lunch. One day when Minecraft was getting some exciting updates on commands, such as commands blocks that run every tick, and scoreboard tags, I realized that I could try to make redstone puzzles in Minecraft. I worked on it a bit, and showed it to Seldom. It was a good project. Also, I found a 'bug' with armor stands, and I got to submit a bug report and change Minecraft forever. haha.\n\n[Seldom] I've been designing this Redstone-inspired puzzle game since 7th grade, sharing puzzles on graph paper with my friends. Vit made an editor in Minecraft because he's awesome. The download is a Minecraft Java 16w05b world. I'll trust you with Google to figure out how to install it.</long>

            <desc>[Seldom] Algorithms and mathematics programming are great, and this is where I got into that.</desc>
            <long>[Seldom] Pascal's Triangle Generator (2015): I always had love for math and programming, so, naturally, I began to make mathematical applications. This is one of them. I taught myself recursion using this, but unfortunately, it was really slow since it recalculates the rest of the triangle above it whenever it needs a new number. The windows .exe is provided, as well as the source code.\n\nPascal's Triangle Generator 2 (2015): I wrote this one using a stack, since I wanted to try them out. It was much slower, though, so I gave up that idea. The windows .exe is provided, as well as the source code.\n\nPascal's Triangle Generator 3 (2015?): This version uses combinations to generate Pascal's Triangle. Much faster, but the factorials get too big and overflow. I planned to make 3.1, but I got busy, and it was never finished. The windows .exe is provided, as well as the source code.\n\n2015 already seems so long ago. It feels like ages since I wrote these.</long>

            <long>[Vit] A website where I have all of my first programming projects, which I worked on with friends (including Seldom) in a group called Bepath. I made almost everything on there following a book on creating games in jQuery. Except Pascal's Triangle Generator. Seldom made that. We had plans to make Platformer 2, and there is a seeeeeecret page on it with a beta version of it. I was the programmer, another guy was our artist, and Seldom was the person who made the other guy's art into digital art. Also, the name of the website is completely unrelated to my real name. Completely.\n\n[Seldom] This is Vit's personal website. He made everything on there except for the Pascal's Triangle Generators. Vit, someone yet unnamed, and I called ourselves Bepath and we dreamed of the sequel to Platformer, Platformer 2. The idea was that the protagonist's parents were captured by aliens, so he went on a journey to save them. The plot and concept are basically Mario. As for the actual website content, most of it is in JavaScript because Vit fell in love with web apps, while I fell in love with desktop apps. That became a main point of teasing and argument between us.</long>

            <desc>[Seldom] My first language was Visual Basic, and then I explored JavaScript, C++, and C#, but those projects are unfortunately lost.</desc>
            <long>[Seldom] My parents bought me Game Programming for Teens for my tenth birthday because I asked how people make games. I taught myself to program in Visual Basic when I was 10. I don't remember what I made very clearly, but I know I copied down the code for a Pong game, but it wouldn't run because I spelled initialize wrong. I made many text-based games, most of which didn't get very far. After that, I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I didn't make much in those. Finally, I taught myself C++, and then C#, but all my personal projects before Pascal's Triangle Generator have been lost because I didn't backup well enough. Anything after that gets into the territory of my later projects. Time really flies, doesn't it?</long>
